Task receipt â€” I want you to produce an immersive, learning-centered markdown recap of everything done in the last ~48 hours 08/28/2025 - 08/30/2025 show the concrete commands and files involved, explain root causes and fixes made on repo and repo UI environments, give prioritized recommendations and next exercises you can run to expand the infra tree and this project. This output will never be committed or tracked. It will permanently stay local. I may command this prompt as last 24 1 or last24 1.
